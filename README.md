# Corisa: AI-Native Development System

Corisa is a revolutionary AI-native development system that lets users describe applications visually or via YAML files. It's designed to replace traditional bootstrapping and maintenance approaches with an intelligent, declarative system powered by AI reasoning.

## 🚀 Vision

Corisa is like **Figma for fullstack apps** - a visual, AI-first abstraction system that generates, maintains, and evolves application structure using declarative YAML. The AI agent can read, modify, upsert, and reason about the YAML intelligently over time.

## 🎯 Key Principles

- **YAML as Source of Truth**: Everything is defined in a comprehensive YAML schema
- **AI-First Design**: Built for AI agents to understand, modify, and evolve
- **Visual + AI Interface**: Not CLI-based, but visual and AI-driven
- **Language Agnostic**: Not tied to specific languages or frameworks
- **Composable Architecture**: Everything is built for high reuse and modularity
- **Continuous Evolution**: AI maintains and enhances the application over time

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Corisa defines applications through these core entities:

```
Menus → Pages → Sections → Components
                ↓
            Buttons → Services → Repositories
```

### Core Entities

- **Menus** → Navigation structure and routing
- **Pages** → UI screens and views (Dashboard, Settings, etc.)
- **Sections** → Page subcomponents (forms, tables, charts)
- **Buttons** → Action triggers bound to services
- **Services** → Core business logic layer
- **Repositories** → Data access layer (DB, APIs)
- **Components** → Reusable UI building blocks

## 🧠 AI Agent Capabilities

The AI agent can:

1. **Generate YAML** from English descriptions
2. **Modify YAML** while preserving relationships
3. **Generate Code** (frontend + backend) from YAML
4. **Evolve Features** systematically
5. **Extract YAML** from existing codebases

### Example AI Interactions

**Request**: "Add user authentication with login/logout"

**AI Response**: 
- Creates login, register, forgot password pages
- Adds authentication service and user repository
- Updates navigation and header components
- Generates all necessary code and database schemas

## 📋 YAML Schema Features

### 1. Comprehensive Entity Definitions
Each entity includes:
- Clear descriptions for AI understanding
- Proper relationships and references
- Validation rules and business logic
- Type definitions and constraints

### 2. AI-Generatable Patterns
The YAML is structured to be easily generated from English:

```yaml
# Pattern: "Create a [page] for [purpose]"
pages:
  - id: "user_profile_page"
    name: "User Profile"
    route: "/profile"
    sections:
      - ref: "profile_form"
```

### 3. Evolution Safety
- Maintains referential integrity
- Preserves existing functionality
- Documents changes for future AI understanding
- Follows consistent patterns

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. Initial Setup
```yaml
# Define your app structure in YAML
app:
  name: "My App"
  pages:
    - id: "dashboard_page"
      sections:
        - ref: "project_list"
```

### 2. AI Evolution
```bash
# AI agent receives request
"Add payment integration with Stripe"

# AI analyzes and updates YAML
- Adds payment pages and forms
- Creates payment service and repository
- Updates navigation and components
- Generates all code automatically
```

### 3. Continuous Maintenance
The AI agent continuously:
- Monitors for feature requests
- Updates YAML schema intelligently
- Regenerates affected code
- Maintains application consistency

## 🎨 Example Application

The included `corisa-app.yaml` defines a complete project management application with:

- **Pages**: Dashboard, Project Detail, Projects, Settings
- **Services**: Project Service with full CRUD operations
- **Repositories**: Project, Task, User, Preferences repositories
- **Components**: Header, Button, Table, Form, Navigation
- **Sections**: Project List Table, Project Summary Card, Forms
- **Buttons**: View, Edit, Delete, Create, Export actions

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Define Your App
Start with a basic YAML schema describing your application structure:

```yaml
app:
  name: "My Application"
  version: "1.0.0"

menus:
  - id: "main_nav"
    items:
      - id: "dashboard"
        label: "Dashboard"
        page_ref: "dashboard_page"

pages:
  - id: "dashboard_page"
    name: "Dashboard"
    route: "/dashboard"
    sections:
      - ref: "welcome_section"
```

### 2. AI Agent Integration
Connect your AI agent to:
- Read and understand the YAML
- Generate code from the schema
- Evolve the application based on requests

### 3. Visual Interface
Build a visual interface (like Figma) that:
- Displays the YAML structure visually
- Allows drag-and-drop editing
- Shows real-time previews
- Integrates with AI agent

## 🔧 AI Agent Integration

### YAML Understanding
The AI agent understands:
- Entity relationships and references
- Business logic and validation rules
- Code generation patterns
- Evolution strategies

### Code Generation
From YAML, the AI generates:
- Frontend components (React, Vue, etc.)
- Backend services and APIs
- Database schemas and migrations
- Configuration files

### Feature Evolution
The AI can:
- Add new features systematically
- Modify existing functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Update related entities

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Rapid Prototyping
- Describe your app in YAML
- AI generates working prototype
- Iterate quickly with AI assistance

### 2. Legacy Migration
- AI analyzes existing codebase
- Extracts structure to YAML
- Enables AI-driven evolution

### 3. Team Collaboration
